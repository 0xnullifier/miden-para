# miden-para

This is the Miden x Para SDK integration. Below, you'll find instructions for local building and linking the library. If you're looking for integrations, see [INTEGRATIONS.md](./docs/INTEGRATIONS.md).

## Requirements

- **Yarn 1.22.22** (enforced via `packageManager` field)
- Node.js (compatible with your project)

This project uses Yarn 1.22.22. The version is locked in `package.json` and will be automatically enforced by modern package managers that support the `packageManager` field.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Building

```bash
yarn build
```

## Local Development & Testing

If you want to test local changes to this package with `@getpara/react-sdk` (or any other Para SDK), you can override the npm-published version using `yarn link`:

### Step 1: Link this package locally

In this repository directory:

```bash
# Build the package
yarn build

# Create a global symlink
yarn link
```

### Step 2: Use the linked package in your project

In your project that uses `@getpara/react-sdk`:

```bash
# Link to the local version
yarn link "miden-para"

# Install other dependencies normally
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Develop and test

Any changes you make to this package:

```bash
# In viem-v2-integration directory
yarn build

# Your linked project will automatically use the updated build
```

### Step 4: Unlink when done

In your project:

```bash
# Remove the link and restore the npm version
yarn unlink "miden-para"
yarn install --force
```
